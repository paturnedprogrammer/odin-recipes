     <p class="brookies"><em>A combination of a brownie and a cookie, these "brookies" are the perfect dessert</em></p>
     
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>1 cup of almond flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate</li>
        <li>1/3 cup cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/3 cup coconut sugar</li>
        <li>4 large medjool dates (pitted, chopped, and soaked)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs (or substitute)</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp melted coconut oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
     </ul>  

     <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl,stir together almond flour, half of the dark chocolate chips, cocoa powder, baking powder, sea salt, and coconut sugar. Add in chopped dates and use a whisk to combine / break up dates into the mixture. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs.</li>
        <li>To the eggs, add the melted coconut oil and vanilla. Combine.</li>
        <li>Melt the remaining half of the dark chocolate chips and fold/stir into the egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and mix until well combined. You should have a semi-tacky dough. Loosely cover and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop out roughly 1 1/2-Tablespoon amounts of dough and place on baking sheet with about a 1-inch gap between each cookie to allow for spreading. Gently press down with palm of hand to form small discs.</li>
        <li>Bake on the center rack for 12-17 minutes or until puffy and no longer wet. Remove from oven and let cool 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Carefully set cookies on wire rack to cool.</li>
        <li>Store completely cooled at room temperature up to 3 days, in the fridge for 4-5 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month.</li>
